# dictionary - a changeable, unordered collection of unique key value pairs - it's also fast because it uses hashing allowing access of a value quickly

# The .items() method in Python dictionaries returns a view object that provides a dynamic view of the dictionaryâ€™s key-value pairs. This view object behaves like a set of tuples, where each tuple contains a key-value pair from the dictionary.

# When you use the .items() method in a for loop, Python iterates over this view object, retrieving one tuple at a time. Each tuple consists of two elements: the key and its corresponding value from the dictionary.
